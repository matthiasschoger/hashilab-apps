Hashilab Core

This project was born out of boredom during the Covid epedemic, when I wanted to replace my already existing Docker homelab with something more advanced. After playing around with k8s for a bit, I decided that Nomad is a great fit for a hobby project, compared to k8s which felt more like something you would do for a job.
